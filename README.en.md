# Moonlight macOS Enhanced

## Black & Crimson and VibePollo Host Stats

On macOS, choose **Settings → App → Appearance → Black & Crimson** (or **View → Appearance → Black & Crimson**) to apply the crimson palette across the client, settings, stream controls, and the host stats window. The setting persists across launches.

Open **Window → VibePollo Host Stats** (⇧⌘H) for live CPU, GPU, RAM, VRAM, encoder, temperature, and network counters. Each graph retains up to five minutes of samples at VibePollo's default two-second polling interval. While a stream to the same host is active, the window also shows client-rendered FPS, network loss, jitter, decode time, render time, video bitrate, and five-minute FPS/loss graphs. Stats do not affect the stream's codec, bitrate, or rendering path.

1. In VibePollo's Web UI, create an API token scoped only to **GET `/api/host/stats`**.
2. Enter the host's Web UI address (for example, `192.168.1.10`; the default HTTPS port is `47990`) and paste the token into the stats window. The token is saved in macOS Keychain.
3. If the host uses a self-signed HTTPS certificate, compare the displayed SHA-256 fingerprint with the host certificate, then explicitly trust it. A certificate change requires a new approval.

The Web UI must allow connections from your Mac's network. Metrics that VibePollo cannot provide on a given host display as **N/A**.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

- **Native macOS client** — AppKit / SwiftUI interface, Apple Silicon and Intel support, dark mode, and bilingual UI
- **Full streaming feature set** — custom resolution and FPS, AV1 / HEVC / H.264 decode, HDR, YUV 4:4:4, MetalFX / VT enhancement, and auto bitrate
- **Multiple video renderers** — includes `Native Renderer`, `Metal Renderer`, and `Compatibility Renderer`; `Native Renderer` is the recommended default, while `Metal Renderer` provides deeper HDR and color controls
- **Clipboard support** — when paired with Foundation Sunshine, Moonlight supports bidirectional copy and paste for text and single-image items, with stream-window focus deciding which session owns clipboard sync
- **Input and control upgrades** — built around a `CoreHID` low-latency, high-polling mouse input path for more direct and more precise relative movement; Free Mouse moves naturally across displays, while Locked Mouse is better suited for games and sustained relative input, with configurable stream shortcuts and controller enhancements
- **Audio and media improvements** — uses a lower-latency `Core Audio` local playback path with multi-channel receive and playback, plus client-side audio enhancement, EQ control, and improved microphone uplink
- **Connectivity and stability** — per-host connection methods, custom ports / IPv6 / domains, performance overlay, diagnostics, and AWDL stability helpers

<details>
<summary><strong>Video / HDR / renderer pipeline</strong></summary>

- Video negotiation covers `AV1 / HEVC / H.264`, HDR, YUV `4:4:4`, remote resolution / FPS overrides, and adaptive bitrate control
- Provides three video playback paths: `Native Renderer`, `Metal Renderer`, and `Compatibility Renderer`
- `Native Renderer` uses `VideoToolbox decode + native sample-buffer presentation` and is the recommended default for lower latency, higher default color accuracy, and stable HDR playback
- `Metal Renderer` uses a deeper `Metal / EDR` presentation path with `HLG / PQ`, HDR metadata source, client HDR profile, luminance parameters, optical output scale, HLG viewing environment, EDR strategy, and tone-mapping policy
- `Metal Renderer` also exposes presentation-timing controls such as display sync, frame queue target, responsiveness bias, and drawable-timeout behavior
- `Compatibility Renderer` keeps the legacy presentation path for older systems, compatibility issues, and recovery scenarios
- The enhancement stack can use `VT Low-Latency Super Resolution`, `VT Quality Super Resolution`, `MetalFX`, `Basic Scaling`, and `VT Low-Latency Frame Interpolation`, with automatic fallback when needed

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Audio / microphone pipeline</strong></summary>

- The default playback path uses a more direct `Core Audio` low-latency local renderer to reduce extra buffering and unnecessary handoff while keeping playback stable
- Supports host `Opus multistream` receive, local decode, negotiation, and playback for `2ch / 5.1 / 7.1 / 7.1.4`
- Real multi-channel devices keep their channel semantics whenever possible; headphones and `2.0 / 2.1` speakers can switch to `Audio Enhancement` for a client-side rerender better suited to stereo listening devices
- `Audio Enhancement` includes presets, EQ, spatial feel, soundstage, and other listening controls for headphones and stereo speakers
- When paired with a compatible Foundation Sunshine host, Moonlight can use the fuller multi-channel negotiation path, microphone uplink, and related enhancement flows

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Host integration / input / diagnostics</strong></summary>

- Mouse input is built around a `CoreHID` low-latency, high-polling path for more direct, more responsive relative movement and a stronger game-control feel
- `Free Mouse` is better for remote desktop, desktop apps, and multi-display setups, letting you move naturally onto other displays; `Locked Mouse` is better for games, FPS titles, and sustained relative input
- The input stack covers `Free Mouse / Locked Mouse`, keyboard shortcut translation, separate physical wheel / smoothed wheel / trackpad strategies, multi-controller support, rumble, Guide emulation, and controller mouse
- Can send Foundation Sunshine host-display extension parameters and let you choose the target display, streaming mode, `display_name`, `useVdd`, `customScreenMode`, and HDR display-profile overrides from host settings or when starting a stream
- When paired with Foundation Sunshine, Moonlight can also use bidirectional clipboard sync for text and single-image items, with stream-window focus deciding which session owns clipboard sync
- Host and network integration also includes per-host connection methods, custom ports, IPv6, domains, `AWDL`, performance overlay, connection warnings, input diagnostics, and both raw and curated logs

## 🔊 Audio and Video

### Video Pipeline
- Custom resolution, FPS, remote resolution, and remote FPS overrides
- Video negotiation for `AV1 / HEVC / H.264`, HDR, YUV `4:4:4`, and adaptive bitrate tuning
- `Native Renderer / Metal Renderer / Compatibility Renderer` presentation paths
- `Native Renderer` is aimed at the lowest latency and highest default color accuracy; `Metal Renderer` is aimed at deeper HDR and color control; `Compatibility Renderer` is kept for older systems and recovery cases

### HDR, Color, and Enhancement
- HDR transfer functions support `HLG / PQ / Auto`, with presentation tuned to the current display path
- `Metal Renderer` exposes HDR metadata source, client HDR profile, luminance parameters, optical output scale, HLG viewing environment, EDR strategy, and tone-mapping policy
- The enhancement stack supports `VT Low-Latency Super Resolution`, `VT Quality Super Resolution`, `MetalFX`, and `Basic Scaling`
- `VT Low-Latency Frame Interpolation` is also integrated into the Metal video path for cadence smoothing on high-refresh displays

### Audio Pipeline
- The default audio path uses a more direct `Core Audio`-oriented low-latency local renderer
- Local receive, decode, negotiation, and playback for `2ch / 5.1 / 7.1 / 7.1.4`
- When the output device supports real multi-channel playback, Moonlight keeps the multichannel layout whenever possible; stereo devices can switch to `Audio Enhancement`
- `Audio Enhancement` is designed for headphones and `2.0 / 2.1` speakers, with client-side EQ, spatial feel, soundstage, and preset control
- When paired with a compatible [Foundation Sunshine](https://github.com/qiin2333/foundation-sunshine), Moonlight can use the enhanced microphone uplink and fuller multi-channel negotiation path

## 🖱️ Input and Control

### Defaults
- **Default mouse mode: Free Mouse**
- **Default mouse driver: Automatic**
- **Automatic order: CoreHID → HID → MFI**

### Mouse Modes
- **Locked Mouse**: better for games and sustained relative motion
- **Free Mouse**: better for remote control, multi-display use, and desktop apps, with natural movement across other displays

### Mouse and Wheel Pipeline
- `CoreHID` provides a lower-latency, higher-polling relative mouse experience for more direct control, finer movement detail, and better sustained aiming or camera motion
- Controls for local cursor, pointer speed, swapped buttons, reverse scroll, and `CoreHID` report-rate cap
- Separate handling for `physical wheel`, `rewritten / smoothed wheel`, and `trackpad` input sources
- Physical wheel modes support automatic, high-precision, and notched behavior, with separate distance, speed, and tail-filter tuning

### Keyboard, Controllers, and Shortcuts
- Keyboard input supports common Windows shortcut translation, custom translation rules, and Moonlight-specific stream shortcuts
- Controller input supports multi-controller sessions, rumble, Guide emulation, and controller mouse mode
- Mouse, Keyboard, and Controller settings have been reorganized so the most-used input controls are easier to reach

### Stream Shortcuts
These Moonlight-specific stream shortcuts can be adjusted in `Settings → Input → Keyboard`:

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `Ctrl` + `Option` | Release mouse capture | While streaming |
| `Ctrl` + `Option` + `S` | Toggle performance overlay | While streaming |
| `Ctrl` + `Option` + `M` | Toggle mouse mode | While streaming |
| `Ctrl` + `Option` + `G` | Toggle fullscreen control ball | Fullscreen only |
| `Ctrl` + `Option` + `W` | Disconnect stream | While streaming |
| `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `W` | Disconnect and quit app | While streaming |
| `Ctrl` + `Option` + `C` | Open control center | Fullscreen / borderless only |
| `Ctrl` + `Option` + `Command` + `B` | Toggle borderless / windowed | Advanced fallback shortcut |

> 💡 This list covers Moonlight-specific shortcuts only. Standard macOS shortcuts such as `⌘W` and `⌃⌘F` are not listed here.
